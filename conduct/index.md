### TL;DR

Be excellent to each other. If a participant is, at the staff’s sole
discretion, harassing or otherwise unacceptably impacting other participants’
ability to enjoy the event, we at all times reserve the right to ask the offending
person to leave.

### Don't Shill ICOs

Eth Barcelona is designed for builders and developers. Do not aggressively shill ICOs
or financial products. If unsure, ask the staff.

### Be Respectful to Speakers and Audiences

Be mindful of volume when you’re in or near speaking halls or workshop rooms.
Noise levels can quickly get out of control and become disruptive to the
programming going on inside!

### Harassment Policy

We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason.
Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a
manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we
deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without refund and
referral to the relevant authorities.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Eth Barcelona - from
attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, and volunteers.

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Eth
Barcelona volunteer or event staff, go to the registration desk, or info
booth.

### Remember

Eth Barcelona is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great
experience for everyone.
