IMPORTANT NOTICE

Due to the current situation with COVID19 in Europe and the multiple travel
bans all around the world, we are moving ethBarcelona to June 17th, hoping that
by then the situation would have improved. We will keep updating the website
with news as the situation evolves.

Thank you for your understanding.
