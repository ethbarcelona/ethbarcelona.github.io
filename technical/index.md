IEEE Cluster 2017 is the 19th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series,
organized in cooperation with SIGHPC.<br>

Clusters are the primary architecture for building today's rapidly evolving
cloud and HPC infrastructures, and are used to solve some of the most complex
problems.  The challenge to make them scalable, efficient, and more functional
requires a community effort in the areas of cluster system design, management
and monitoring, at the hardware, system, middleware and application levels.<br>

Following the successes of previous <a href="http://www.clustercomp.org">IEEE
Cluster conferences</a>, for IEEE Cluster 2017, which will be held September
05-08, 2017 in Hawaii USA, we again solicit high-quality original work that
advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields.  All
papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed for their originality, technical depth
and correctness, potential impact, relevance to the conference, and quality of
presentation. Research papers must clearly demonstrate novel research
contributions while papers reporting experiences must clearly describe lessons
learned and impact, along with the utility of the approach compared to previous
ones.<br>

<h4>Student travel awards - for students at U.S. institutions</h4>

Several travel awards are sponsored by the National Science Foundation for
students enrolled in US institutions and participating in the Student Mentoring
Program at the IEEE Cluster 2017 conference. Students with accepted papers
in the main conference track or in workshops, or students with posters must
apply to and participate in the Student Mentoring Program to be eligible for
the travel award. Notice of travel awards will be made prior to the conference.
The travel awards will be distributed post-conference in the form of
reimbursements against actual travel, registration, and accommodation expenses
submitted by the student. Both graduate and undergraduate students can apply.<br>


<h6>2017 Highlight: Convergence of Big Data and High-Performance Computing.</h6>

While the tools and cultures for High-Performance Computing and Big Data
Analytics have evolved in divergent ways, both rely on cluster architectures.
As we witness an increasing awareness that further progress in scientific
research depends on both areas, the interoperability and scaling convergence of
these two ecosystems is expected to be critical to the future. Therefore, we
have chosen this year to highlight  research topics in all areas expected to
bring progress in understanding if, why and how clusters should support this
convergence. Specific topics are dedicated to this direction within all
conference areas alongside more traditional topics. <br>

Authors must indicate the primary area of preference out of the four areas
below. They may optionally rank the other areas. The paper may be accepted as a
full 10-page paper, or the committee might decide to accept it as a short paper
with 4 pages in the proceedings. Note: references are not counted in the above
limits on the number of pages. <br>
